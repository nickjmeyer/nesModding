* TODO Gut broken NES components
  - [ ] Clean inside

* TODO Install RetroArch on Odroid C1
  - [X] Install Android
  - [ ] Clone RetroArch repo and install
  - [ ] Check sound and video
  - [ ] Obtain ROMs and test with keyboard and mouse

* TODO Mod Controllers for games and mouse
  - [-] Writing the code [80%]
    - [X] Begin with starter kit and simple projects
    - [X] Implement simple button program to send keystroke to host
    - [X] Get a MWE for the nRF24L01+ modules
    - [X] Send the keystroke over the nRF24L01+ connection
    - [ ] Setup the one way communication
  - [ ] Power efficiency [%]
    - [ ] Measure the amperage with the multimeter
    - [ ] Determine battery life for coin,AA,Li-ion
    - [ ] Research constructing an Arduino from scratch
      - [ ] Micoprocessor
      - [ ] Voltage
      - [ ] Clock rate
      - [ ] Too many other tings...
  - [ ] Mod Wii Nunchuck to be a mouse [%]
    - [ ] Supplies
      - [ ] Wii Nunchuck
      - [ ] Arduino Mini (no USB dongle, smaller profile)
      - [ ] USB serial connection for Arduino (need for programming)
      - [ ] USB cable
      - [ ] Breadboard and cables for staging
    - [ ] Configure arduino to send Nunchuck output to julia via serial
    - [ ] Write julia script to send serial messages as mouse commands
    - [ ] Test reliability and plug/unplug
  - [ ] Mod NES controllers to send keyboard inputs for ROMs [%]
    - [ ] Supplies
      - [ ] NES controller for XBMC
      - [ ] Console controllers for ROMs
      - [ ] Arduino Mini
      - [ ] USB serial connection for Arduino
      - [ ] USB cable
      - [ ] Breadboard and cables for staging
    - [ ] Configure controller to send keyboard inputs via julia script
  - [ ] Mod other controllers [%]
    - [ ] SNES
    - [ ] N64
